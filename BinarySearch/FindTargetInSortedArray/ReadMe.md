# Rotated Sorted Array Search

## Problem 

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7  might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Input : [4 5 6 7 0 1 2] and target = 4
Output : 0


## Approach

The idea is to get the pivot in the array.

Then do binary search on the either side of the array, on basis of target.
